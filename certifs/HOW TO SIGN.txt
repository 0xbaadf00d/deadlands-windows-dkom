1. Let's say you want to install the PSPLinkusb driver. First you want to generate your own root certificate for that driver with:

makecert -$ individual -r -pe -ss "Deadlands Drivers" -n CN="Deadlands Drivers" deadlands_signed.cer



2. Then you install the certificate you just created to the trusted root directory:

certmgr /add deadlands_signed.cer /s /r localMachine root




3. Finally, you sign EACH .sys file using the certificate:

signtool sign /v /s "Deadlands Drivers" /n "Deadlands Drivers" DEADLANDS.sys
